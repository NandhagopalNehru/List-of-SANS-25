# List-of-SANS-25
List of SANS 25

The SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Institute is a leading organization in the field of information security. They maintain a list of the top 25 most dangerous software vulnerabilities, known as the SANS Top 25, which is updated every year based on emerging threat trends and new attack vectors. Here are the SANS Top 25 vulnerabilities as of 2021:

Improper Input Validation: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly validate user input, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the system.

Buffer Overflow: This vulnerability occurs when an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the system.

Injection Flaws: Injection flaws occur when an application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the system. Examples include SQL injection and LDAP injection.

Improper Output Handling: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly validate and sanitize output before displaying it to the user, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the user's browser.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web page, which is then executed by a victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions.

Resource Management: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly manage system resources such as file handles, sockets, and memory. This can allow an attacker to exhaust system resources or launch denial-of-service attacks.

Cryptographic Issues: This vulnerability occurs when an application uses weak or broken cryptographic algorithms or does not properly implement cryptography, leaving it open to attacks such as eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Authentication Issues: Authentication issues occur when an application does not properly authenticate users or fails to properly protect user credentials, leaving them open to attacks such as brute-force attacks and credential stuffing.

Authorization Issues: Authorization issues occur when an application does not properly restrict access to resources based on user roles and permissions, allowing an attacker to access sensitive resources or perform unauthorized actions.

Configuration Management: This vulnerability occurs when an application or system is not properly configured, leaving it open to attacks such as brute-force attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks.

Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This vulnerability arises when an application or system does not properly log events or monitor for suspicious activity, making it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.

Time and State: This vulnerability arises when an application or system does not properly handle time and state information, leaving it open to attacks such as replay attacks and race conditions.

Errors: This vulnerability arises when an application or system does not properly handle errors, leaving it open to attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks.

Cryptographic Storage Issues: This vulnerability occurs when sensitive data is not properly encrypted or is stored in an insecure manner, allowing an attacker to access and exploit the data.

Session Management Issues: This vulnerability arises when an attacker is able to bypass or otherwise exploit the authentication and session management mechanisms of an application, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

Input Validation: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly validate user input, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the system.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to trick a user into executing an action on a web site without their knowledge or consent, such as clicking a button or submitting a form.
